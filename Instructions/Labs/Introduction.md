# Advanced GitHub Copilot Hands-On Lab

#### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

This hands-on lab is designed to immerse you in the advanced capabilities of GitHub Copilot. Moving beyond autocomplete, you will explore how AI-powered tooling can transform the entire software development lifecycle—from project scaffolding and contextual refactoring to infrastructure automation and agent-driven development.

Through guided exercises, you will gain practical experience with GitHub Copilot Edits, Agent Mode, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. By the end of the lab, you will be equipped to strategically apply GitHub Copilot across real-world development scenarios, enhancing productivity, code quality, and team collaboration.

## Objective

This lab equips you with hands-on experience using GitHub Copilot to enhance software development workflows. You will explore advanced features such as Agent Mode, Copilot Edits, Infrastructure as Code generation, and Model Context Protocol integration. 

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and manage projects using GitHub Copilot.
- Apply GitHub Copilot Edits for multi-line and contextual code refactoring.
- Prompt Copilot effectively to generate complete API endpoints and scaffold web applications.
- Explore the Agent Mode in GitHub Copilot and understand its benefits over Ask Mode.
- Build a functional micro-application using Agent Mode for task-driven development.
- Use GitHub Copilot to author Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts with tools like Terraform and Bicep.
- Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create richer, contextual prompts for more accurate and targeted AI assistance.

## Architecture

The architecture of **Advanced GitHub Copilot Capabilities** goes beyond simple suggestions to act as a full **AI-driven development assistant** across the software lifecycle. At its core, **GitHub Copilot** enables **project scaffolding** for collaborative development. It provides **Copilot Edits** for contextual refactoring and generating features like **API WebApps**, enhanced by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for richer prompts. In parallel, it supports **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform or Bicep, while integrating with **GitHub Web** for seamless editing, versioning, and deployment. Together, these features streamline **code creation**, **infrastructure automation**, and **application scaffolding** in a unified ecosystem.
