## Lab Objectives

Moving away from the IDE, we will now focus on reviewing the capabilities of the Coding Agent inside the GitHub.com UI. After finishing this lab, participants will be able to...

- Feel comfortable utilizing GitHub Copilot both in an IDE and on GitHub
- Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue
- Ask Copilot to review a Pull Request
- Generate a Pull Request Summary
- View GitHub Copilot as a full workflow assistant rather than _just_ an IDE tool

## Task 1: Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue

After creating an issue, participants will assign it to GitHub Copilot and view the Agent's process.

1. In a new browser tab, click the __Issues__ tab inside the repository.

For the new issue, fill in an appropriate title and description to add cart functionality to the application.
