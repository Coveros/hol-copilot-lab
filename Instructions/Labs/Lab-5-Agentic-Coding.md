# Exercise 5 - Agentic Coding

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- Feel comfortable utilizing GitHub Copilot both in an IDE and on GitHub
- Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue
- Ask GitHub Copilot to review a Pull Request
- Generate a Pull Request Summary
- View GitHub Copilot as a full workflow assistant rather than _just_ an IDE tool

## üçé Scenario: Freeing Up Your Hands with Coding Agent

Business is picking up at The Daily Harvest, and you have found yourself at the end of what you can handle by yourself. Perhaps it would be helpful to have an extra pair of hands (figuratively speaking) to free you up to work on other projects.

Your task today is to use GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent to kickstart some work throughout different phases of the development lifecycle:

- Set Coding Agent to transform an Issue into a Pull Request
- Have Coding Agent review a Pull Request
- Generate an automated summary of a Pull Request

## ‚å®Ô∏è Introduction to Coding Agent

Unlike the IDE modes of Ask, Edit, and Agent, Coding Agent works within the GitHub.com user interface. Rather than engaging in a back and forth, iterative approach, utilizing Coding Agent involves delegating tasks to the Agent, giving the agent time to work, then returning to see the results of GitHub Copilot's work.

Coding Agent can...

- Fix bugs
- Implement incremental new features
- Improve test coverage
- Update documentation
- Address technical debt

## üìù Step 1: Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue

After creating an issue, you will assign it to GitHub Copilot and view the Agent's process.

__Instructions:__

1. In a new browser tab, click the __Issues__ tab inside the repository.
2. Then, on the right-hand side of the screen, click "New Issue".
3. For the new issue, fill in an appropriate title and description to add a _Contact Us_ page to the application.

<details>
  <summary>Example Issue</summary>
  <img width="993" height="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/688ee09c-c68e-49c1-847b-66ba699a6a28" />
</details>

Once complete, create the issue.

4. In the metadata section of the issue under "Assignees", click the "Assign to Copilot" button.
5. In the pop-up window, ensure the target repository and base branch are both accurate, then click "Assign".
6. In the audit trail (or in the metadata sidebar) for the issue, click on the linked pull request.

In the __Conversation__ tab of this new Pull Request, you should now see a button labeled "View Session" that you should click. If nothing is showing, wait a few moments, refresh the page, and try again.

Take a few moments to peruse this page and see all the steps GitHub Copilot is taking to meet your issue's needs.

## üëÄ Step 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to review a Pull Request

With new functionality ready to be reviewed, we can now utilize Coding Agent to analyze the work completed and provide feedback on both functional and stylistic issues with incoming Pull Requests.

__Instructions:__

1. With the Pull Request finished by GitHub Copilot, we are going to return to the __Conversation__ tab in the Pull Request and click the cogwheel in the "Reviewers" section of the metadata
2. Now, choose "Copilot" as your reviewer and scroll to the bottom of your Pull Request conversation
3. You should see the various critiques GitHub Copilot has regarding this particular Pull Request after a brief wait

## Task 3: Ask GitHub Copilot to generate a summary of a Pull Request

As great as it is to have GitHub Copilot work through a new feature request or bug report, it can also be very helpful to utilize the tool to bring us up to speed on a Pull Request already in the works.

__Instructions:__

1. Scrolling to the bottom of your Pull Request, take note of the UI for your comment text box. Click on the GitHub Copilot logo, then click "Summary".
2. After a few moments, you should see a summary drafted up by GitHub Copilot that you can submit into the Pull Request's conversation.

<details>
  <summary>Example Summary</summary>
  <img width="941" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ff26d2-1ea5-4f81-af49-3879c8fbd42e" />
</details>

## ü•∑ Extra Credit: Use GitHub Advanced Security + Copilot to fix a code vulnerability

So far, we've looked at utilizing Coding Agent to handle improved functionality. Now, we are going to see how it handles resolving security vulnerabilities.

__Instructions:__

1. At the top of your repository UI, click the __Security__ tab
2. Navigate to the __Code scanning__ section under the "Vulnerability alerts" header in the sidebar
3. Click on the code scanning alert that has been generated by GitHub Advanced Security titled "DOM text reinterpreted as HTML"
4. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Code scanning alert UI and to understand the current issue
5. At the top of the page, just below the title, notice the `Speed up the remediation of this alert with Copilot Autofix for CodeQL` text, and click the "Generate Fix" button in that text box
6. Once GitHub Copilot has generated a fix, scroll below the proposed change and click "Commit to a new branch"

At this point, resolution of this vulnerability has moved into a similar workflow as with our other changes. It may be ready to submit as a Pull Request where it will be reviewed and (hopefully) merged to keep your code base safe.

## üèÜ Exercise Wrap-up

### üéØ Key Skills Practiced:

- Utilize Coding Agent to handle Issues
- Utilize Coding Agent to review Pull Requests
- Create a generated summary of a Pull Request's contents
- Utilize Coding Agent to resolve a Code Scanning vulnerability in GitHub Advanced Security

### üí° Reflection Questions:

1. **How might you use different Issue/Pull Request label to help influence the type of response you receive from Coding Agent?**

2. **Should GitHub Copilot be the only reviewer on a Pull Request? If so, what are the trade-offs of foregoing human reviewers? If not, how might you supplement your current review process with Coding Agent?**

## üîÆ Coming Up Next:

In Exercise 6, we'll take a look at extending GitHub Copilot's knowledge base through the use of **MCPs**, providing new functionality and information to smooth out your workflows.
