# Exercise 5 - Agentic Coding

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- Feel comfortable utilizing GitHub Copilot both in an IDE and on GitHub
- Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue
- Ask GitHub Copilot to review a Pull Request
- Generate a Pull Request Summary
- View GitHub Copilot as a full workflow assistant rather than _just_ an IDE tool

## üçé Scenario: Freeing Up Your Hands with Coding Agent

Business is picking up at The Daily Harvest, and you have found yourself at the end of what you can handle by yourself. Perhaps it would be helpful to have an extra pair of hands (figuratively speaking) to free you up to work on other projects.

Your task today is to use GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent to kickstart some work throughout different phases of the development lifecycle:

- Set Coding Agent to transform an Issue into a Pull Request
- Have Coding Agent review a Pull Request
- Generate an automated summary of a Pull Request

## ‚å®Ô∏è Introduction to Coding Agent

Unlike the IDE modes of Ask, Edit, and Agent, Coding Agent works within the GitHub.com user interface. Rather than engaging in a back and forth, iterative approach, utilizing Coding Agent involves delegating tasks to the Agent, giving the agent time to work, then returning to see the results of GitHub Copilot's work.

Coding Agent can...

- Fix bugs
- Implement incremental new features
- Improve test coverage
- Update documentation
- Address technical debt

## üìù Step 1: Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue

After creating an issue, you will assign it to GitHub Copilot and view the Agent's process.

__Instructions:__

1. In a new browser tab, click the __Issues__ tab inside the repository.
2. Then, on the right-hand side of the screen, click "New Issue".
3. For the new issue, fill in an appropriate title and description to add a _Contact Us_ page to the application.

<details>
  <summary>Example Issue</summary>
  <img width="993" height="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/688ee09c-c68e-49c1-847b-66ba699a6a28" />
</details>

Once complete, create the issue.

4. In the metadata section of the issue under "Assignees", click the "Assign to Copilot" button.
5. In the pop-up window, ensure the target repository and base branch are both accurate, then click "Assign".
6. In the audit trail (or in the metadata sidebar) for the issue, click on the linked pull request.

In the __Conversation__ tab of this new Pull Request, you should now see a button labeled "View Session" that you should click. If nothing is showing, wait a few moments, refresh the page, and try again.

Take a few moments to peruse this page and see all the steps GitHub Copilot is taking to meet your issue's needs.

## üëÄ Step 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to review a Pull Request.

With new functionality ready to be reviewed, we can now utilize Coding Agent to analyze the work completed and provide feedback on both functional and stylistic issues with incoming Pull Requests.

__Instructions:__

1. With the Pull Request finished by Copilot, we are going to return to the __Conversation__ tab in the Pull Request and click the cogwheel in the "Reviewers" section of the metadata
2. Now, choose Copilot as your reviewer and scroll to the bottom of your Pull Request conversation.

## Task 3: Ask Copilot to generate a summary of a Pull Request

As great as it is to have GitHub Copilot work through a new feature request or bug report, it can be also very helpful to utilize the tool to bring us up to speed on a Pull Request already in the works.

__Instructions:__

1. Scrolling to the bottom of your Pull Request, take note of the UI for your comment text box. Click on the GitHub Copilot logo, then click "Summary".
2. After a few moments, you should see a summary drafted up by GitHub Copilot that you can submit into the Pull Request's conversation.

<details>
  <summary>Example Summary</summary>
