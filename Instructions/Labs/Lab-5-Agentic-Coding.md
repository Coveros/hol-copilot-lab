# Lab 05: Agentic Coding

Duration : 35 minutes

## Lab Overview:

Lorem ipsum

## Lab Objectives

Moving away from the IDE, we will now focus on reviewing the capabilities of the Coding Agent inside the GitHub.com UI. After finishing this lab, participants will be able to...

- Feel comfortable utilizing GitHub Copilot both in an IDE and on GitHub
- Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue
- Ask Copilot to review a Pull Request
- Generate a Pull Request Summary
- View GitHub Copilot as a full workflow assistant rather than _just_ an IDE tool

## Task 1: Assign GitHub Copilot to an Issue

After creating an issue, you will assign it to GitHub Copilot and view the Agent's process.

1. In a new browser tab, click the __Issues__ tab inside the repository.

Then, on the right-hand side of the screen, click "New Issue".

For the new issue, fill in an appropriate title and description to add cart functionality to the application.

<details>

</details>

Once complete, create the issue.

2. In the metadata section of the issue, click the cogwheel next to "Assignees"

In the pop-up window, ensure the target repository and base branch are both accurate, then click "Assign".

3. In the audit trail (or in the metadata sidebar) for the issue, click on the linked pull request.

In the audit trail of this new Pull Request, you should now see a button labeled "View Session" that you should click. If nothing is showing, wait a few moments, refresh the page, and try again.

Take a few moments to peruse this page and see all the steps GitHub Copilot is taking to meet your issue's needs.

## Task 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to review a Pull Request.

1. With the Pull Request finished by Copilot, we are going to return to the __Conversation__ tab in the Pull Request and click the cogwheel

2. Now, choose Copilot as your reviewer and scroll to the bottom of your Pull Request conversation.

## Task 3: Ask Copilot to generate a summary of a Pull Request

Scrolling to the bottom of your Pull Request, take note of the UI for your comment text box. Click on the GitHub Copilot logo, then click "Summary".

After a few moments, you should see a summary drafted up by GitHub Copilot that you can submit into the Pull Request's conversation.
