### Administration and Enablement

(Should live in the PPT.)

### Billing

(Should live in the PPT.)

## Complete Technical Prerequisites

### Log Into GitHub

(Should live in the PPT.)

### Set Up the Lab Environment

(Do these steps belong in the PPT or here in the Markdown file?)

## Understand the Repository

### Review Repository and Project Structure

(It is difficult to write about this until I know what application we'll be working with during the remaining labs.)

### Select Language for the Remaining Labs

While completing these hands-on exercises you will be able to choose between four languages. <<List those languages and tell students what they need to do (if anything) to select one of them.

## Review the Project

### Project Purpose

(It is hard to say what this is going to look like until I know the current state of the project.)

### Improvements Needed

(See above.)

## Goals for Remaining Labs

The goal during the lab is to implement these needed improvements while demonstrating the following Copilot features:
 - Code Editing
 - Agent Mode
 - Agentic Coding
 - MCP
 - Customizing Copilot
