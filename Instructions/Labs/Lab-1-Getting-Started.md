### Task 1: Overview of Admin for GitHub Copilot Enablement & Billing (Read Only)

This task equips participants with foundational knowledge and administrative skills to enable, configure, and manage GitHub Copilot—including **Copilot for Business** and **Copilot Enterprise**—within an organization.


1. Understand GitHub Copilot Licensing

GitHub Copilot is licensed **per user**, and is available through the following SKUs:

| SKU                    | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Copilot for Business** | For organizations: includes centralized policy controls and team management. |
| **Copilot Enterprise** | Advanced enterprise-grade offering with enhanced security, compliance, and integration with enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML SSO). |

- You can view the assigned Licenses by navigating to your organization **Settings** and **Copilot > Features**.

>  *Note:* Both **Copilot for Business** and **Copilot Enterprise** support centralized billing, policy enforcement, and user provisioning.


2. Configure GitHub Copilot Access

To enable and configure Copilot access:

- Navigate to **Enterprise > Policies > Copilot**
- Choose access scope:
  - All organization members
  - Specific teams or individual users
- Set **repository access policies** to control what code Copilot can reference:
  - Public repositories only
  - Public + selected private repositories


3️. Assign Users & Manage Access

User provisioning and license assignment can be done via:

- **GitHub Enterprise Admin Console**
- **Organization Settings > Members & Teams**

Best practices:
- Use **Teams** to bulk-assign Copilot access
- Monitor activation and usage via the **Copilot Usage Dashboard**

4. Billing & Cost Management

- Billing is **monthly or annual**, based on active users
- View invoices and usage under **Settings > Billing**
- Use **Copilot Usage Reports** to track:
  - Adoption trends
  - ROI metrics
  - License utilization

> Consider **license pooling** or **reassignment** for inactive users to optimize costs.

5. Define Key Roles in GitHub Copilot Administration

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enterprise Admin**  | Manages Copilot enablement, policies, and billing across the organization.       |
| **Billing Manager**   | Oversees license purchases, invoicing, and cost optimization.                    |
| **Copilot Champion**  | Drives adoption, supports onboarding, collects feedback, and promotes best use.  |
| **Security Admin** *(Copilot Enterprise)* | Ensures compliance, configures identity integrations, and monitors repository access boundaries. |

### Task 2: Log in to GitHub & Set Up Lab Environment

In this task, participants will prepare their technical workspace using **Copilot Agent Mode**. Instead of manually executing commands, learners will craft and submit **natural language prompts** to GitHub Copilot, allowing it to scaffold their environment, generate boilerplate code, and guide setup steps interactively.

1. Navigate back to the home page of your repository by clicking the **Code** **(1)** tab located at the top left of the screen. Click the **Code** **(2)** button located in the middle of the page. 

   ![](../../media/23-7-25-g9.png)

1. Click the **Codespaces (1)** tab on the box that pops up and then click the **Create codespace on main (2)** button.  If you don't see the "Create Codespace" button, it likely means your repository wasn't created under the **Cloudlabs-enterprises** organization. To fix this, either delete your current repository and recreate it under the specified organization or fork the existing repository into **Cloudlabs-enterprises** Org.

   ![](../../media/23-7-25-g10.png)

   >**Note**: If a pop-up prompt doesn't appear in the browser to open Visual Studio Code, manually launch Visual Studio Code from the desktop and close it. Next, return to the browser, refresh the page, and launch the codespace that was previously created.

1. You will encounter a pop-up prompt: **This site is trying to open Visual Studio Code.** Click **Open** to proceed. Subsequently, another pop-up window will appear within Visual Studio Code (VS Code), where you should select **Install Extension and Open URI** to continue.

   ![](../../media/23-7-25-g10.1.png)

    >**Note**: Click on **Allow** if "The extension **Github Codepsaces** wants to sign in using Github" pop-up appears.

      ![](../../media/23-7-25-g13.png)

1. On **Select user to authorize Visual Studio Code** page click on **Continue** 

    ![](../../media/23-7-25-g14.png)

      >**Note:** If you get an error connecting to the browser like _"this page isn't working right now, 127.0.0.1 didn't send any data," close the browser window then in VS Code, click on **Cancel** and select **Yes** to try a different method. It will redirect to a new page for authentication. You may need to try this a couple of times to sign in to Copilot. 

1. On the **Visual Studio Code is requesting additional permissions** tab, click **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code**.

    ![](../../media/23-7-25-g15.png)

1. On the **This site is trying to open Visual Studio Code** pop-up, click **Open** to launch VS Code via vscode.dev.

    ![](../../media/c3.png)

1. You are now signed-in to your GitHub account in Visual Studio Code. Click on the **GitHub Copilot** icon from the top and select **Agent** from the dropdown.

### Task 3: Review Repo & Select Language

In this task, participants will explore their scaffolded repository, understand the lab’s technical and instructional goals, and choose their preferred development language—either **TypeScript (React/Vite)**, **TECH STACK 2**, **TECH STACK 3**, or **TECH STACK 4**. They'll use **Copilot Agent Mode prompts** to review their environment.

1. Explore the Project Structure

Encourage learners to open their repo in Visual Studio Code and inspect the folder layout. If desired, they can ask Copilot to explain the purpose of each file and folder in the repository.

<details>
  <summary>Need a hint? Try this prompt.</summary>
  > Walk me through the structure of this repository. Explain the purpose of each folder and file.

  This prompt helps learners understand the modular design and encourages Copilot to provide contextual guidance.
</details>

3. Choose Your Development Language

Participants now select their preferred stack:

| Language              | Use Case                         | Strengths                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **TypeScript**        | TBD                              | TBD                                          |
| **LANGUAGE 2**        | TBD                              | TBD                                          |
| **LANGUAGE 3**        | TBD                              | TBD                                          |
| **LANGUAGE 4**        | TBD                              | TBD                                          |

Ask Copilot for guidance on how to configure your environment for your chosen stack.

<details>
  <summary>Need a hint? Try this prompt.</summary>
  > I want to work in [Python / C#]. Help me configure my environment and update any launch settings or dependencies accordingly.

  This prompt allows Copilot to tailor the environment setup based on the learner’s choice.
</details>

Follow the guidance provided by Copilot for configuring your environment.
