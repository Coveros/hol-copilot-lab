## Set Up GitHub Copilot

### Administration and Enablement

(Should live in the PPT. Pull from existing PPT deck?)

### Billing

(Should live in the PPT. Pull from existing PPT deck?)

## Complete Technical Prerequisites

### Log Into GitHub

(Should live in the PPT.)

### Set Up the Lab Environment

(Do these steps belong in the PPT or here in the Markdown file? We also need to get these from Spektra (or through TJ).)

## Understand the Repository

### Review Repository and Project Structure

(It is difficult to write about this until I know what application we'll be working with during the remaining labs.)

### Select Language for the Remaining Labs

While completing these hands-on exercises you will be able to choose between four languages. <<List those languages and tell students what they need to do (if anything) to select one of them.>>

## Review the Project

### Project Purpose

(It is hard to say what this is going to look like until I know the current state of the project. Below is a suggestion from the work breakdown document.)

Something like you were just moved onto this project and tasked with taking over support of it. One idea we had was maybe a project with limited or no tests in it.

### Improvements Needed

(See above.)

## Goals for Remaining Labs

The goal during the lab is to implement these needed improvements while demonstrating the following Copilot features:
 - Code Editing
 - Agent Mode
 - Agentic Coding
 - MCP
 - Customizing Copilot
