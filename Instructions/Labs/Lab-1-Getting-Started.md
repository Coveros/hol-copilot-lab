## Set Up GitHub Copilot

### Administration and Enablement

(Should live in the PPT. Pull from existing PPT deck?)

### Billing

(Should live in the PPT. Pull from existing PPT deck?)

## Complete Technical Prerequisites

### Log Into GitHub

(Should live in the PPT. Should this instead appear after the step "Set Up the Lab Environment"? Are students supposed to be logging into GitHub through Spektra's platform?)

### Set Up the Lab Environment

(Do these steps belong in the PPT or here in the Markdown file? We also need to get these from Spektra (or through TJ).)

## Understand the Repository

### Review Repository and Project Structure

This structure of this repository is as follows:
 - .github/ - Contains workflow files for managing the labs.
 - Instructions/Labs/ - Contains one file for every lab that you will complete.
 - demoApp/ - Stores the code and configuration for a simple demo application written in four languages that you will modify during the labs.
 - README.md - Helps newcomers get oriented to this repository.
 - masterdoc.json - <<TBD -- Ask Phil.>>

### Select Language for the Remaining Labs

While completing these hands-on exercises you will be able to choose between four languages. <<List those languages and tell students what they need to do (if anything) to select one of them.>>

## Review the Project

### Project Purpose

You have just moved onto a project for developing a shopping website for a local grocery store. The previous developers failed to deliver an application with all of the required
features and did not perform any testing.

### Improvements Needed

You have been tasked with developing the missing features and ensuring that the appliction is well-tested.

(It is difficult to say more than this until the remaining labs have been completed and we know what features and tests will be added.)

## Goals for Remaining Labs

The goal during the lab is to implement these needed improvements while demonstrating the following Copilot features:
 - Code Editing
 - Agent Mode
 - Agentic Coding
 - MCP
 - Customizing Copilot
